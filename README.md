PROJECT : Dater

Description : 
Little project that read an directory structure in the form of YYYY/[MM/DD/]file and change each file creation date to the appropriate directory structure. 

Over the years, I had my photo album collection move from one disk to another, but creation dates (for some reasons) do not follow, or in some cases, photo were edited to adjust color, format, etc. thus altering the modified date. This project override the file date to whatever is in the directory structure.
